# Debugging&Troubleshooting 
Need to define `socialMedia` in [Footer.jsx](https://github.com/KrystalZhang612/KDev-Cryptocurrency-Web3.0-UI/blob/main/src/components/Footer.jsx) to let the social media icons display & clear console errors:<br />
Import the social media svg or png icons from [src/assets/index.js](https://github.com/KrystalZhang612/KDev-Cryptocurrency-Web3.0-UI/blob/main/src/assets/index.js):
```javascript
import linkedin from "./linkedin.svg";
import github from "./github.png";
```
Export:
```javascript
export{
linkedin,
github,
...
}
```
Import icon assets into Footer:
```javascript
import { linkedin } from "../assets";
import { github } from "../assets";
```
Define `socialMedia` at the bottom right:
```javascript
const socialMedia = [
  { id: 1, icon: linkedin, link: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystalzhang612/" },
  { id: 2, icon: github, link: "https://github.com/KrystalZhang612" }
];
